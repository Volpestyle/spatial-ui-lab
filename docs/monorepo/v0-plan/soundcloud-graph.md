# apps/soundcloud-graph – SoundCloud explorer

For later, but v0 checklist:

- Set up app scaffold
- Add UI for SoundCloud OAuth + token storage
- Call SoundCloud API to fetch:
  - Followed artists
  - Some metadata/stats
- Build `Graph<ArtistData, EdgeData>` with graph-core
- Render with graph-three
- Reuse gesture-react + handtracking-tfjs as in sandbox
- Add minimal artist details panel when node clicked
